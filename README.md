# project-pushy

### Mission
I began work on Pushy to ~~recreate a Mario Party mini-game of a similar name~~push myself towards libraries and frameworks for java game development. Work on Pushy allows me to familizarize myself with libGDX and re-practice Git for an upcoming project that requires both.
##### Mentions
libGDX: [site](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html) and [github page](https://github.com/libGDX/libGDX).
[Pushy Penguins](https://www.mariowiki.com/Pushy_Penguins).

### Development Cycle
Pushy was begun on libGDX's Gradle based [setup app](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html). The folders `core/` and `desktop/` are the only ones of importance - I will not target the remaining platforms.

#### Features
[x] Pushy will load into an ~interactive~ splash screen
[x] Bare-bones Menu screen from which a game of Pushy will 
[ ] A game of Pushy similar to Mario Party 5's Pushy Penguins
[ ] Ability to pause/ unpause game in order to ~~cheat~~plan a route through the pengs

### Download
Pushy will not be made available to download at this time in this repo.
